NOTES ON CSS:

The width of the ::marker scales with the font-size. So should the dropdown icon. In the mockup, the font-size is 16px, and the dropdown icon is 8px, hence the width of 0.5em.
    dw = 0.5em

The margins I used can be calculated by the following:

Let mw be the default ::marker width, which is approximately measured as 0.375em.
    mw = 0.375em

Let mmr be the default ::marker margin-right, which is approximately measured as 1em.
    mmr = 1em

The ::marker and the dropdown icon should be aligned vertically, so the margin-left of the dropdown icon should be:
    dml = - (dw - mw) / 2 = -0.0625em

Then, to determine the margin-right (dmr) of the dropdown icon:
    dml + dw + dmr = mml + mw + mmr
    -0.0625em + 0.5em + dmr = 0 + 0.375em + 1em
    dmr = 0.9375em

New calcs:

dw = 1em
mw = 0.375em
mmr = 1em

dml = - (dw - mw) / 2 = - (1em - 0.375em) / 2 = - 0.3125em

dml + dw + dmr = mml + mw + mmr
-0.3125em + 1em + dmr = 0 + 0.375em + 1em
dmr = 0.6875em
